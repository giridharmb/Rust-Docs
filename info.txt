What is a Database Connection?
Any software application needs to store the data in a database
and for the application to interact with a database server, we
need a Database Connection. The Database connection is nothing
but a way for the application software to interact with the database
server software and we use the connection to send commands (SQL) to
the database and obtain the response from the database in the form of a Result Set.
